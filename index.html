        <h2>Life Story</h2>
        <p>Growing up in Oakland, I wasn't exposed to the many arcane pleasures in life, it being a more conservative city than most. One would assume that living in such a suffocating environment would have stunted a festive spirit such as I, but not even the cold malice of Oakland's many shadow fiends could darken the enclosure in which my soul resides.</p> 
        <p>Living in those conditions only made me more resolute, each article I penned serving as another rung on the ladder on which I climbed steadfastedly out of that molasses pit of a city. Nothing could have prepared me more for the ceaseless trials of adulthood.</p>
